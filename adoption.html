<div class="two"> <p id="b"> First of all, thank you for believing in our family and adopting a street/abandoned dog and giving it a forever home and saving a life. <br> You had a choice to buy a purebred dog, to fit in with society and do what everyone else is doing, but you didn't! <br> You see the problem, it's everywhere, it surrounds us and you realize that we are the solution to this problem. <br>

There are some important things to know about adopting any dog or bringing a new dog home, and with street dogs and puppies, there are just a few more considerations to think about.  <br>

Before we get started with the things that you may need to buy and training that you may have to do, it is important to note that this is a journey for both you and the dog. <br> The dog is going to go through a big change in his or her life as well. So please be patient as the dog has trusted you to take him/her <br> into your lives and we should always provide the best life that the dog can get. <br> Have patience with yourself, the dog can be a great teacher if we are willing to watch <br> and learn their behaviors, we will, in turn, learn a lot about ourselves as well. </p> </div> <br> 

<h1 style="text-align:center;"> TERMS & CONDITIONS </h1>
	<p id= "list">	In order to be considered for an adoption, you must: <br> <ul>
<li>Be at least 18 years of age. </li>
<li>Have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in your household. </li>
<li>Have the landlord’s consent to bring an animal onto the property. </li>
<li>Puppy or adult has to be given a 14 days chance to settle and get to know their new family, their new boundaries, new home and environment and new ways. They will be unsettled and consider their Haven their home so when moved they are unsure, become stressed and need reassuring thus a 14 days chance will give them the time to adapt. </li>
<li>We don’t allow dogs/pups to be adopted to homes with already unsterilized pets, as it contradicts to our belief of the importance of sterilization, not only from a breeding perspective but also for all the health benefits of having your pets sterilized. </li>
<li>When the animal is no longer wanted they have to be returned to us, as you are their adoptive family but they still belong to LLF and therefore cannot be handed down to family members or friends, or sold, or given away to other organizations. </li>
<li>All our animals do not get adopted on a “whoever chooses the pet first will get it” but it is rather the best home for that animal that will be chosen first. HENCE, A SMALL INTERVIEW WITH ANY ONE PANEL MEMEBER SHALL BE HELD. </li>
<li>Animals can’t be adopted as gifts for families, friends or children. Children are only allowed pets as long as their parents remain responsible until the child is old enough. </li>
<li>Please do understand adopting a rescue dog other animal is for life (10-15 year commitment), not a few days, weeks or months, it is FOR LIFE! So make sure you are ready for this commitment. </li> </ul> </p>
