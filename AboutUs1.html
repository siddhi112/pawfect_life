		<p class="testimonial_text"> I come from a family where dogs are loved and cherished. School and college days I used to be around with my darling pet, Snickers, but worklife diverted me from my time with Snickers and eventually she became a victim of depression. I took a break from my work to spend more time with Snickers and that's where it hit me hard that so many abandoned/stray dogs face the same. That was the birth of "All Are Pawfect"!! </p>

		<p class="testimonial_text"> After the death of Oreo, it took me months to recover from the shock. He was killed in a road accident. After 7 years of being with Oreo, losing him to a road accident was something that I never would've imagined. After counselling, I started off with preparing instructions for drivers regarding animal safety on roads. Later on, I joined Dr. Ross Geller, who worked earnestly towards the similar cause through "All Are Pawfect". </p>

		<p class="testimonial_text"> During my university days, I was assigned by my college to volunteer for an NGO as a part of a project. Back then, I came across this budding NGO, "All Are Pawfect". I chose this NGO for my love for doggos and the variety of breed they had sheltered. With the passing time, I bonded so well with the pets over there, they became my family. Post-Graduation, I was offered to work for them and I couldn't be happier.  </p>

<p class="idea"> 
	All Are Pawfect is India’s leading independent stray dogs NGO. We work in 18 states of India. Started in 2008 in India, and registered as ‘Non-Vocal Foundation’, we have changed the lives of more than 70,000+ dogs. <br> <br>

Every dog deserves to be treated with sheer care & respect. That’s why we are fiercely committed to ensuring street & abandoned/homeless dogs not only survive, but thrive. Bold in our ambition and powerful in our care, we do whatever it takes to save these voiceless creatures.

We have programs currently in place to try and change public attitudes and promote action towards conditions and factors that compromise the well-being of animals. Our current programs cover feeding strays, providing medical aid, sterilization, vaccinations, adoption, fostering and much more. We are collaborating with schools as part of our education and awareness program to teach/inspire kids and build a better relationship with animals and the environment. We also work with other NGOs who do their part to prevent animal suffering. <br> <br>
 
Follow our continuing story and see the impact our foundation has on improving the lives of animals. As we go forward, we hope that you will join us and become a part of this story. Animals
need you to advocate for them and together with your support, we hope to extend our services nationwide and make India a better place for them. <br> <br>
